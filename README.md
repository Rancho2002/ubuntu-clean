##### After these system maintenance tasks, there's another script section that deals with removing old revisions of snaps:

It sets the script to exit if any command fails (set -eu) and specifies the language as English (LANG=C).

snap list --all | awk '/disabled/{print $1, $3}' lists all installed snaps that are disabled and extracts the snap name and revision number.

It then loops through the list of disabled snaps, removing them one by one using snap remove.

Finally, it sends a desktop notification using notify-send to indicate that the cleaning is done.
